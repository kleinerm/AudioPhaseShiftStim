# AudioPhaseShiftStim
Experimental Psychtoolbox-based playback of pure tones via multiple audio channels,
with individual per-channel windowing and phase shifting.

Needs at least a 3 channel sound card, with channel 1 for the fixed phase
"bone conduction" output, and channels 2 and 3 for stereo left-ear / right-ear
output to head phones.

Needs at least Psychtoolbox 3.0.18.11, which is not yet released.
Until it is relased, the PsychPortAudio driver from Psychtoolbox
3.0.18.11 can be downloaded from the following links:
